# Hey there, I'm Dr4kfire üëã

I'm a passionate game developer specializing in Godot, with over 5 years of experience and many experimental projects along the way. At 16, I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering high school student in Poland, always learning new things‚Äîfrom creating custom game mechanics in Godot to diving into C++ with Raylib. I develop primarily on Linux using the Godot Engine.

## About Me

I‚Äôve been experimenting with game design and development for years, blending horror, humor, and innovative mechanics. Whether it's challenging myself with new programming languages or pushing the boundaries of game development, every project inspires my next creative venture. Alongside my passion for horror games, I‚Äôm always cooking up new ideas and exploring different genres‚Äîfrom roguelites to arcade experiences.

## Projects Overview

### Current Projects
- **Horror Granny-FNaF:**  
  A horror puzzle game merging the tension of FNaF with the eerie atmosphere of Granny.
  
- **Roguelite Dungeon Crawler:**  
  An early-stage dungeon crawler inspired by modern titles like Diablo and Minecraft Dungeons.

### Past Projects
- **Scalar (GMTK Game Jam 2024):**  
  A Godot puzzle platformer developed with a friend for the GMTK Game Jam. It features a ‚Äúscale gun‚Äù mechanic to adjust object sizes. Although it was buggy, had softlocks, and received poor ratings, every bug was a lesson learned!

- **Dodge:**  
  An arcade-style spaceship dodging game marking my first self-made project (without following a tutorial). It‚Äôs not my best work, but it helped me get started.

### Future Ideas
I'm also toying with some concepts for the future:
- A party game reminiscent of Mario Party.
- A unique card game where players build a body using ‚Äúorgan cards‚Äù and engage in quirky battles with diseases!

*(These ideas are still far from the prototype phase, but I like to keep my creative mind active.)*

## Skills & Tools

- **Game Engines & Frameworks:**  
  - Godot (5+ years of experience)  
  - Raylib (C++ experiments)
  
- **Languages:**  
  - GDScript, C#, JavaScript, and learning C++
  
- **Operating System:**  
  - Linux (Ubuntu)

## A Bit About My Passions

- I‚Äôm a horror game enthusiast with a penchant for quirky puzzles and experimental mechanics.
- I love the challenge of learning new programming languages and tools‚Äîeven when it means wrestling with C++ or reinventing gameplay mechanics.
- Every project, no matter how rough or early-stage, inspires my next creative venture.
