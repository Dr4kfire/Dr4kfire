# Hey there, I'm Dr4kfire üëã

I'm a passionate game developer specializing in Godot, with over 5 years of experience and many experimental projects along the way. At 16, I‚Äôm a Computer Engineering high school student in Poland, always learning new things‚Äîfrom creating custom game mechanics in Godot to diving into C++ with Raylib. I develop primarily on Linux using the Godot Engine.

## About Me

- **Game Development:**  
  I‚Äôve been experimenting with game design and development for years. I enjoy pushing boundaries by blending horror, humor, and innovative mechanics.
  
- **Current Projects:**  
  - **Horror Granny-FNaF:** A horror game combining elements of Granny and FNaF. Expect tense puzzles and a playful twist with nods to my school life.
  - **Roguelite Dungeon Crawler:** An early-stage project inspired by modern dungeon crawlers like Diablo and Minecraft Dungeons.

- **Past Projects:**  
  - **Scalar:**  
    Developed in Godot with a friend for the GMTK Game Jam, this puzzle platformer featured a ‚Äúscale gun‚Äù mechanic to adjust object sizes. It was a buggy, rough experience with softlocks and poor ratings‚Äîbut an invaluable learning journey.
  - **Dodge:**  
    My first self-made arcade game (unassisted by tutorials), where you control a small spaceship to dodge asteroids. It‚Äôs not my best work, but it helped me get started.

- **Future Ideas:**  
  While still in the early conceptual phase, I‚Äôm dreaming about:
  - A party game reminiscent of Mario Party.
  - A unique card game where players build a body using ‚Äúorgan cards‚Äù and engage in quirky battles with diseases!
  
  *(These ideas are still far from the prototype phase, but I like to keep my creative mind active.)*

## Projects Overview

### Current Projects
- **Horror Granny-FNaF:**  
  A horror puzzle game merging the tension of FNaF with the eerie atmosphere of Granny.
  
- **Roguelite Dungeon Crawler:**  
  An early-stage dungeon crawler exploring procedural challenges and roguelite dynamics.

### Past Projects
- **Scalar (GMTK Game Jam):**  
  A Godot puzzle platformer with a scale-altering mechanic. It didn‚Äôt turn out as polished as I‚Äôd hoped, but every bug was a lesson learned!
  
- **Dodge:**  
  An arcade-style spaceship dodging game marking my first non-tutorial project.

## Skills & Tools

- **Game Engines & Frameworks:**  
  - Godot (5+ years of experience)  
  - Raylib (C++ experiments)
  
- **Languages:**  
  - GDScript, C#, JavaScript, and learning C++
  
- **Operating System:**  
  - Linux

## A Bit About My Passions

- I‚Äôm a horror game enthusiast with a penchant for quirky puzzles and experimental mechanics.
- I love the challenge of learning new programming languages and tools‚Äîeven if it means wrestling with C++ or reinventing gameplay mechanics.
- Every project, no matter how rough or early-stage, inspires my next creative venture.
